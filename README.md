This project is a backend Spring Boot API for an e-commerce platform. It provides functionality for user authentication, product browsing and filtering, category management, and shopping cart operations. The API is designed to support a frontend application (such as a web or mobile client) and uses JWT authentication for secure access to protected endpoints.
